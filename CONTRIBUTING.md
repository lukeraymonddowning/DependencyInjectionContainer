# Tests
I won't accept a pull request if it does not have passing tests and a minimum of 98% code coverage. 

# Feature Requests
Tupper is designed to be small and no-nonsense. As such, whilst I will be adding features to Tupper and would love to hear your ideas, I will be very strict on what qualifies. Before you submit a feature request, ask yourself the following two questions:

1) Does this fall directly under the umbrella of IoC?
2) Is it a feature that will be used by more than 90% of users?

If the answer to both questions is yes, post the request!
